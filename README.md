🍷 Wine Quality Analysis (EDA)

This project focuses on Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of the Wine Quality dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The objective is to understand how various physicochemical properties of wine influence its quality score and to uncover meaningful patterns, trends, and relationships within the data.

🔍 Key Objectives

Understand the structure and distribution of wine features

Identify correlations between chemical properties and wine quality

Detect outliers and data imbalance

Perform data cleaning and feature exploration

Generate visual insights to support data-driven conclusions

🧪 Dataset Overview

Source: UCI Machine Learning Repository

Type: Tabular (Red & White Wine variants)

Features include:
fixed acidity, volatile acidity, citric acid, residual sugar,
chlorides, free sulfur dioxide, total sulfur dioxide, density,
pH, sulphates, alcohol

Target Variable: quality (score between 0–10)

🛠️ Tools & Techniques Used

Python

Pandas & NumPy for data manipulation

Matplotlib & Seaborn for visualization

Statistical analysis & correlation heatmaps

Distribution plots, boxplots, and pairwise analysis

📊 Key Insights

Alcohol content shows a strong positive correlation with wine quality

Volatile acidity negatively impacts quality

Most wines are rated between 5 and 6, indicating class imbalance

Several features exhibit skewness and outliers requiring careful handling
